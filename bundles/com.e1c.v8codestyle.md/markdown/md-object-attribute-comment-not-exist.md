# Document does not have the "Comment" attribute

For all documents, it is recommended to create the attribute Comment
(string of unlimited length). In this prop, users can
write down various official notes on the document, which
do not relate to the application specifics of the document (for example, the reason for marking
for deletions, etc.). Access to props for users should be
configured in the same way as for the document itself (if the document is available only
for reading, then the comment is read-only; if there is a right
document record, then the attribute value can also be changed).
